## Introduction

Assister is a mobile app designed to provide support and guidance to refugees using generative AI technology. It offers personalized advice, education opportunities, and job recommendations, aiming to make the integration process into their new environment smoother than ever.

### The Problem

1. **Language Barriers:** Many refugees face challenges communicating in their host country due to language barriers, hindering their access to crucial resources and information.

2. **Lack of Access to Healthcare:** Refugees may struggle to access medical care, making it difficult to address health issues and maintain good health.

3. **Difficulty Finding Job Opportunities:** Without access to job opportunities, refugees may have trouble supporting themselves in their new home.

4. **Lack of Knowledge about the New Environment:** Refugees often lack essential information about their new environment, leading to feelings of being lost and unsafe.

### Generative AI Chatbot

- **Interactive:** Assister's chatbot provides personalized advice and support to refugees, fostering engagement.
- **Conversational:** The chatbot uses natural language processing to communicate with refugees in a human-like manner.
- **Adaptive:** With each interaction, the chatbot learns, becoming more intelligent and responsive over time.

## Features

- **News Updates:** Assister provides daily news updates tailored to refugees' locations, helping them stay informed about the local environment.
